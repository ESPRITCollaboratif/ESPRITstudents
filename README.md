ESPRITstudents
==============

This is an RTS (real time strategy) game that's based on the school's maps and students data . Avatars should be extremely related to real persons to touch the final user (witch will be inputing his own data) . IA will be basically teachers only. Highest IA IQ will be attributed to "administationStaff" as the major "team" in the game. The real time functionnalities are done Javascript throught node.js and other frameworks.Graphics would be OpenGL mainly as it's highly customisable and Free lib.The main concept in this game is to replace "Races" with "Clans","teams", and ,"classemates" , witch anyone could join but with conditions fixed later. I'm open to any other propositions.
